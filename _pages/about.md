Welcome to my personal blog. My name is Ka-Wai Lin. I'm maried, a father, a Christian, Dutch with Chinese background and working as a software engineer/consultant/developer for Info Support.

As a developer I have a great passion for the following topics:

* Software architecture
* Software principles like clean code, SOLID, (unit) test automation etc.
* C# & .NET
* Open Source Software

I've setup this blog to write interesting posts (mostly about software development). Inspired by people like [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/), [Rob Conery](http://rob.conery.io/), [Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com) (and many more)

PS: Why a donkey as a profile picture? It's a picture that my wife took and tagged me for the first time on Facebook. I've kept it ever since :wink:
